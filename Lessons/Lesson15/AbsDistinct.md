# AbsDistinct
## Level: Easy
## Complexity: O(N) or O(N*log(N))
### Description:

A non-empty array A consisting of N numbers is given. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order. The absolute distinct count of this array is the number of distinct absolute values among the elements of the array.

For example, consider array A such that:

      A[0] = -5
      A[1] = -3
      A[2] = -1
      A[3] =  0
      A[4] =  3
      A[5] =  6
The absolute distinct count of this array is 5, because there are 5 distinct absolute values among the elements of this array, namely 0, 1, 3, 5 and 6.

Write a function:

    function solution($A);

that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N numbers, returns absolute distinct count of array A.

For example, given array A such that:

      A[0] = -5
      A[1] = -3
      A[2] = -1
      A[3] =  0
      A[4] =  3
      A[5] =  6

the function should return 5, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

* N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
* each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647];
* array A is sorted in non-decreasing order.
